# node-cli-hangman

Command line hangman game based on the Legend of Zelda. Built with Node.js, and the inquirer.js NPM package, which is used to easily accept user input.

This app was built to demonstrate the use of constructor functions, which you will find in Word.js, and Letter.js

To play, simply make your way to the root of the project and run,

```
node index.js
```
